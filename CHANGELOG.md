## 4.1.0 (2024-06-01)
* Upgrade dependencies and drop support for Python < 3.10 and Pydantic <2.7.
* Add the capability to generate embedded Base64 SVG images as data URIs through template tags (in addition to the API capability introduced in version 4.0.1).

* BREAKING CHANGES:
    * QR code options have been factorized and now use the `QRCodeOptions` class.
