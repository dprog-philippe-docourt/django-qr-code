## Reporting a Vulnerability

### **🔐 Vulnerability Disclosure Policy**

We take the security of our systems seriously and value the contributions of the security community. If you believe you’ve found a security vulnerability in our systems or services, we encourage you to report it to us responsibly. This policy outlines how to report vulnerabilities, what you can expect from us, and how we handle reported issues.

### 📬 How to Report a Vulnerability

If you discover a potential security issue, please report it by sending an email to: security[at]dprog.net

Please include the following in your report (if available):

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Affected systems or services
- Proof of concept or screenshots
- Your contact information (so we can keep in touch)

### ⏳ What to Expect After Reporting

Once we receive your report, we commit to the following:

1. **Acknowledgment** – We'll acknowledge your report within **3 business days**.
2. **Assessment** – We'll assess the vulnerability and determine its validity and impact.
3. **Status Updates** – You’ll receive updates **at least every 7 business days** while we investigate and mitigate the issue.
4. **Resolution Time** – Depending on severity, resolution may vary, but we aim to address critical vulnerabilities within **30 days**.

### ✅ If the Vulnerability is Accepted

- We’ll work to remediate the issue as quickly as possible.
- With your permission, we may credit you publicly for the discovery.
- You may be eligible for a token of appreciation or bug bounty (if applicable).

### ❌ If the Vulnerability is Declined

- We’ll explain why the issue was not considered a security vulnerability (e.g., duplicate report, intended behavior, or out-of-scope).
- You’ll still receive full communication and transparency throughout the process.

### 🚫 Scope and Safe Harbor

We request that you:

- Avoid accessing or modifying data that is not yours.
- Avoid privacy violations, service disruption, or data destruction.
- Do not use automated scanning tools that generate high traffic.

If you act in good faith and follow this policy, we will not initiate legal action against you for your responsible disclosure.
